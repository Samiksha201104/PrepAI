      "explanation": "Here's a short-answer question with its answer and explanation based on the provided context:\n\n**Question:** What is a key characteristic of effective bibliographic databases, and why is it important for researchers?\n\n**Answer:** Bibliographic databases are useful for collecting citation-related information and abstracts of research articles. It is important for researchers to identify specific databases relevant to their research area to avoid limitations posed by any single database.\n\n**Explanation:** The text defines bibliographic databases as \"abstracting and indexing services\" that help collect citation and abstract information. It then stresses the importance of a researcher being able to \"quickly identify the databases that are of use\" to their exploration, implying that a broad, one-size-fits-all approach is not ideal and can lead to being \"limited by the intrinsic shortcoming of any one of them for quality research.\"",

  "summary": "Here's a summary of the provided context in four concise bullet points:\n\n*   **Literature Review's Purpose:** A literature review is crucial for identifying research problems, understanding existing approaches, determining the novelty of proposed research, and establishing a strong foundation by analyzing and synthesizing prior art.\n*   **New Knowledge and Existing Knowledge:** New knowledge is built upon and interpreted within the context of existing knowledge, which is discovered through surveying established and recent literature, providing the basis for originality and significance.\n*   **Critical Reading and Analysis:** Effective technical reading involves critically evaluating sources for authority, accuracy, and scope, analyzing hypotheses, models, and experimental conditions, and comparing/contrasting information to identify gaps and weaknesses.\n*   **Utilizing Bibliographic Databases:** Tools like Web of Science, Google, and Google Scholar are essential for scholarly research, offering various search functionalities to identify relevant literature and trace knowledge flow, though each has its own limitations and requires strategic use of search operators."
