  "summary": "Here are 3-5 bullet points summarizing the provided context:\n\n*   A literature review identifies problems, justifies approaches, and ensures novel contributions by synthesizing existing knowledge.\n*   Existing knowledge provides context, significance, and originality for new research, necessitating careful reading and critical evaluation.\n*   Bibliographic databases like Web of Science and Google Scholar help researchers find relevant scholarly materials, but require effective search strategies.\n*   Technical reading involves understanding concepts, models, and algorithms, critically analyzing sources for authority, accuracy, and scope.\n*   Proper attribution and citation acknowledge sources, facilitate knowledge flow, and build a strong foundation for research."
