An effective review of literature ensures a firm foundation for advancing knowledge, facilitates theoretical growth, eliminates as areas that might be of interest, and opens new avenues of possible work • Generally, a good literature survey is the first expectation of a supervisor from the research student, and when done well can create a good impression that the state of art in the chosen field is well understood"
